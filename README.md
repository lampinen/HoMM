# HoMM 

A library for meta-mapping (<https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.04318>).

**Meta-mapping** provides a new perspective on zero-shot task performance, by framing it as a problem of transforming a prior task. 

**HoMM** provides a parsimonious homoiconic implementation of this framework.

See the examples and paper for further details. The application to the domains from the paper can be found as follows:

Polynomial domain experiments: code in the examples folder and at <https://github.com/lampinen/HoMM_polynomial_analysis>

Card games domain: <https://github.com/lampinen/meta_cards> 

RL domain: <https://github.com/lampinen/homm_grids>

Visual concepts domain: <https://github.com/lampinen/categorization_HoMM> 

This code has generally been tested with CUDA 10, Tensorflow 1.14, and Python 3.6.
