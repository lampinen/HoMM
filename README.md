# HoMM 

A library for Homoiconic Meta-mapping (<https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09950>).

**Meta-mapping** provides a new perspective on zero-shot task performance, by framing it as a problem of transforming a prior task. 

**HoMM** provides a parsimonious implementation of this framework.

See the examples and paper for further details. (Note that the results in the paper were not produced with this library, to reproduce those results exactly you may need to use the code at <https://github.com/lampinen/polynomials> and <https://github.com/lampinen/meta_cards>. This library is intended to provide a cleaner and more flexible implementation of the framework.)

Additional examples of the use of this library can be found at in my repositories for an RL application (<https://github.com/lampinen/homm_grids>) and for a visual categories experiment (<https://github.com/lampinen/categorization_HoMM>).
